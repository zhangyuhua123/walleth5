    <p>One of the major benefits of a public blockchain is the transparency of the chain itself; everyone is welcome to access and read the data, free of barriers and of charge. Writing on the chain however, requires resources to be used by the Nodes managing the chains. This is due to their processes intended to prevent malicious code and junk information from entering the network, essentially maintenance costs. This upkeep of integrity is done by HPB’s High-Performance and Candidate Nodes consuming computing power and electricity costs, with added business and operational costs on top. The way we incentivize HPB’s High-Performance and Candidate Nodes to maintain the network, is through gas fees.</p>
    <p>High Performance Nodes will prioritize transactions with a sufficient gas amount and higher gas prices, while the lower gas amounts taking on a lower priority. This is paid by the end user (those who are sending the transactions).  The end result is a marginal to ensure that the transaction is quickly processed, while the processors have plenty of reason to ensure the safety and integrity of your transaction.</p>
    <p> Transaction fee of HPB = Gas Amount * Gas Price (Gas price per unit, determined by HPB)</p>
